This chart will install RHDH + orchestrator plugin + Serverless Workflows.

It is under development and meant for non-prod environment for now

To get RHDH's ingress host location:
    $ oc get ingress {{ .Release.Name }}-backstage -o jsonpath='https://{ .spec.rules[0].host }{"\n"}'

If you are running locally with kind and ingress controller then it should be http://localhost:9090

To get the serverless workflow operator status:
    $ oc get deploy -n sonataflow-operator-system 

To get the serverless workflows status:
    $ oc get sf 

You should now have RHDH with the orchestrator plugin installed to manage your deployed workflows.
